# Hint.css [v1.3.0]
*A tooltip library in CSS for your lovely websites*

`hint.css` is written as a pure CSS resource using which you can create cool tooltips for your web app. It does not rely on JavaScript and rather uses **data-* attribute**, **pseudo elements**, **content property** and **CSS3 transitions** to create the tooltips. Also it uses **BEM** naming convention particularly for the modifiers.

[Read more about it](http://kushagragour.in/blog/2013/02/years-first-side-project-hint/).

###Try it out:
http://kushagragour.in/lab/hint/

If you find this useful and want to show some love & encouragement, I am on [Gittip](https://www.gittip.com/chinchang/).

## Get Started

Get the library using one of the following ways:

1. **Github**

 - [unminified] : https://raw.github.com/chinchang/hint.css/master/hint.css
 - [minified] : https://raw.github.com/chinchang/hint.css/master/hint.min.css

2. **Bower**

 ```
 bower install hint.css
 ```

3. **CDN**

 [http://www.jsdelivr.com/#!hint.css](http://www.jsdelivr.com/#!hint.css)

Now include the library in the *HEAD* of your page:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="hint.css"></link>
```
or

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="hint.min.css"></link>
```

Any element on your page which needs to have a tooltip has to be given at least one of the position classes: `hint--top`, `hint--bottom`, `hint--left`, `hint--right` to position the tooltip.

```html
Hello Sir, <span class="hint--bottom">hover me.</span>
```

The tooltip text needs to be given using the `data-hint` attribute on that element.

```html
Hello Sir, <span class="hint--bottom" data-hint="Thank you!">hover me.</span>
```

[ **Note**: The `hint` class is no more required and is deprecated. Tooltip is shown on elements which have the `data-hint` attribute instead.]

Use it with other available modifiers in various combinations. Available modifiers:
- `hint--error`
- `hint--info`
- `hint--warning`
- `hint--success`
- `hint--always`
- `hint--rounded`
- `hint--bounce`

## Changing the prefix for class names

In case you like to change 'hint--' to 'hint-' or any preferred prefix, simply update `src/hint-variables.scss` and change `$prefix`.
