# hint.css
*A tooltip library in CSS*

`hint.css` is written as a pure CSS resource using which you can create cool tooltips for your web app. It does not rely on JavaScript and rather uses **data-* attribute**, **pseudo elements**, **content property** and **CSS3 transitions** to create the tooltips. Also it uses **BEM** naming convention particularly for the modifiers.

*Note: CSS3 Transitions on pseudo elements is currently available on Firefox only. On rest of the browsers it degrades gracefully without any transition. Though the good news is that it will be [coming soon on webkit](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=92591) also.*

###Try it out:
http://kushagragour.in/lab/hint/

## Get Started
Download one of the 2 library version:

- [unminified] : https://raw.github.com/chinchang/hint.css/master/hint.css
- [minified] : https://raw.github.com/chinchang/hint.css/master/hint.min.css

And include it in the *HEAD* of your page:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="hint.css"></link>
```
or

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="hint.min.css"></link>
```

Any element in your markup which needs to have a tooltip has to be given atleast 2 classes: <code>hint</code> & any one of `hint--top`, `hint--bottom`, `hint--left`, `hint--right` to position the tooltip.

```html
Hello Sir, <span class="hint  hint--bottom">hover me.</span>
```

The tooltip text needs to be given using the `data-hint` attribute on that element.

```html
Hello Sir, <span class="hint  hint--bottom" data-hint="Thank you!">hover me.</span>
```

Use it with other available modifiers in various combinations. Available modifiers:
- `hint--error`
- `hint--info`
- `hint--warning`
- `hint--success`
- `hint--always`
